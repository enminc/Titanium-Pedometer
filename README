Titanium Studio Pedometer (beta) for iOS & Android.
- Created to study the impact of positive reinforcement on physical activity.
- There are issues with the iOS accelerometer working as a background process when the app is minimized.
- Current build only works properly for Android.
- When a goal of 10,000 steps is reached, the time-lapsed and phoneID are sent to a database to record the results.
